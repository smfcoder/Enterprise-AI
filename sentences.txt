My admittance to the University. 
i am happy .
I felt ashamed when I fought with my mother on some issue, and a caused her trouble.
I had to leave my girlfriend for 4 weeks because of my studies. a This happens frequently. The last 24 hours before my departure a are always very depressing. 
i am unhappy.
I insulted a couple of good friends of mine and even tried to hit a them when I was drunk.  The next day, I was ashamed of course.
